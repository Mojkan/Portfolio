# Chain Mail

## Game Description
In Chain Mail, you play as Snot, the goblin kingdom's most dedicated mailman, in his quest to personally deliver the letter of surrender to the human king. Master of the eccentric fighting style Chain-Fu, you swing your mail bag around using a large golden chain to smash, crush and trip your enemies as you make your way to the throne room.

Play through the Campaign and fight your way through the castle's rooms and roofs to reach the king, or take a break in Endless mode and try to reach a new high score.

## Knockback on enemy and player
In Chain Mail when the player throws itself or the bag it can give knockback to enemies. This gives damage to the enemies, but it also gives the player a chance to push the into holes or out of the windows. The knockback force and direction is dependent on different enemies and what direction you are rotating in. The speed of the hit when throwing the player will both affect the damage and the knockback force.
